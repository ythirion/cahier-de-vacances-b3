# Cahier de Vacances B3
Welcome to your **Cahier de Vacances** – a journey into a simulation unlike any other. 
This project will challenge your logic, discipline, refactoring skills, and design thinking through weekly, hands-on coding challenges.

Each mission is rooted in a part of the system that has begun to evolve, destabilize, or simply... get weird. 
Your job is to dive in, understand the anomaly, and extend or clean up the construct without corrupting the whole.

## Concept
This is not just about solving puzzles.  
It’s about **learning by improving**, **practicing clean code**, and **thinking like a craftsperson** — all within a narrative that evolves each week.

Every challenge contains:
- A **story** with context and purpose.
- A **starting codebase or specification**.
- A set of **reflection questions** to help you consolidate your learning.

You choose your tools. You write the code. You rewrite the rules.

## 🕶️ The Story – *You Are Neo Now*
You didn’t ask for this.
But the system chose you.

The Matrix is breaking down—glitch by glitch, subsystem by subsystem.
From the navigation core to the behavioral engines, fragments of unstable logic are surfacing.
They were buried. Forgotten. Rewritten a hundred times over.

But now, the system is calling you in.

> **You are Neo.**

You’ve been reinserted into the construct — not to follow, but to lead.
To repair what’s collapsing.
To face code that resists understanding.
To rewrite rules that were never meant to be seen again.

You’re not just solving puzzles — you’re **walking through a dangerous virtual world** where every piece of logic could be a trap, every shortcut a choice with consequences.

Zion’s operators are watching.
They will guide you when they can.
But in the end, only you can decide what the code becomes.

> Will you just fix bugs?
> Or will you reshape the system to make it better for those who come after you?

Every change you make is an act of resistance.
Every line of clean, expressive code is a rejection of entropy.

**Welcome to your real training.**

## What You Have to Do
### 1. Fork the repository
Start by forking this repo into your own GitHub space.
> _Everything happens in your own construct._

### 2. Follow weekly instructions
Each week, a new mission will be unlocked in a folder named `/week-01`, `/week-02`, etc.  
Inside, you'll find:
- A story
- Starting code or specs
- A clear goal
- Reflect questions

### 3. Choose your language
Each challenge is designed to be implemented in **any language you prefer**.  
You'll find placeholders (or create your own) inside each week’s folder.

### 4. Iterate in micro-steps
- Don’t try to solve everything at once.
- Commit early, commit often.
- Use [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for clarity.

✅ Examples:
```bash
feat: add basic rule engine for simulation
test: add draw scenario for matching player choices
refactor: extract rule map for extensibility
```


### 5. Reflect on your work
At the end of each mission, answer the **reflect questions** provided.
They will help you:
* Think about your process
* Observe how your mindset evolves
* Connect code decisions with real-world design concerns

You can write them in a `reflect.md` file or a comment thread — your call.

### 6. Cooperate
> *The Matrix was not meant to be faced alone.*

- Help each other.
- Pair up, review code, challenge solutions, share refactors.
- Learning is part of the simulation.
