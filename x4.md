# Deploy the Grid

**Codename**: *Automate the Revolution*
**Client**: Encorp Rebellion Ops Division

## 🧠 Situation Report

You’ve breached the firewall.
You’ve rewritten the rules.
You’ve gone live.

But now, it’s time to **automate the entire operation**.
Manual updates are too slow.
The Encorp system is watching.

Your mission:
🎛️ Build a **complete CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**,
🚀 **Deploy your system** across real hosting providers,
🔁 And **connect the entire Grid** with a single push.

---

## 🎯 Mission Phases

### 🔹 Phase 1: Build Your Integration Pipeline

Create a **GitHub Actions workflow** triggered on every push and PR.

Your pipeline must:

1. ✅ **Run Linters**

   * ESLint for frontend
   * Backend-specific linter (e.g. `flake8`, `checkstyle`, `eslint`, etc.)

2. 🧪 **Run Tests**

   * Unit tests on frontend and backend (Jest, JUnit, xUnit, etc.)

3. 📊 **Collect Code Quality Metrics**

   * Optional: integrate with Codecov, SonarCloud, or generate HTML reports

4. 📦 **Bundle Artifacts**

   * Build frontend with Vite (`vite build`)
   * Build backend and ensure the SQLite file is ready

🎯 Output: Your build is green, code is clean, and everything is bundled.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Manual Deployment (First Contact)

Manually deploy your **frontend** and **backend + SQLite** to public providers:

**Frontend Deployment Options:**

| Platform         | Method                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Vercel           | GitHub integration or manual |
| Netlify          | Upload `/dist` or GitHub     |
| Surge.sh         | `npx surge dist`             |
| GitHub Pages     | Deploy static build manually |
| Infomaniak / OVH | FTP or Docker deploy         |

**Backend Deployment Options:**

| Platform         | Stack Support | Notes                            |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Render           | Most stacks   | Persistent SQLite support        |
| Railway          | Most stacks   | Good with GitHub + SQLite        |
| Fly.io           | Most stacks   | Deploy near user                 |
| Heroku           | Node, Python  | Classic, good free tier          |
| Infomaniak / OVH | Any           | Use Docker / CLI / FTP if needed |

📌 **Ensure your deployed frontend points to the correct live API URL.**

### 🔹 Phase 3: Connect It All — CI/CD Deployment

Update your **GitHub Actions pipeline** to include deployment:

1. 🧱 **Frontend Deployment**

   * Use CLI (`vercel --prod`, `surge`, `netlify deploy`) in GitHub Actions
   * Or push static files to `gh-pages` branch

2. 🛠 **Backend Deployment**

   * Trigger deploy using Render/Fly.io CLI
   * Push to a GitHub branch linked with Heroku / Railway / Render auto-deploy

3. 🔑 **Environment Variables & Secrets**

   * Store tokens and credentials in GitHub Secrets (`Settings > Secrets`)
   * Never commit credentials to code!

## ✅ Final Submission Checklist

* [ ] GitHub Actions pipeline runs linting, tests, quality checks, and builds artifacts
* [ ] Manual deployment to one provider for frontend, one for backend is functional
* [ ] Deployment steps are automated in the pipeline
* [ ] GitHub repo is well-structured and documented
* [ ] Live URL for both frontend and backend is shared
