# Encorp Mainframe Breach Operation

**Mission Codename**: *Firewall Cracker*
**Client**: Encorp

---

## 🧠 Context: The Mission

Welcome, User.
You’ve been recruited by **Encorp Resistance** to breach the megacorp’s encrypted **firewall**.
To get through, you must submit a **valid password**... but Encorp’s system is ruthless. Any deviation triggers a **trace**.

Your objective:
⚡ Build a futuristic password validation app using **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript** that simulates this grid-level firewall.

---

## 💾 Security Rules (a.k.a. The Firewall Protocol)

You must check every password against **Encorp's security algorithm**. A valid password:

* Has **at least 8 characters**
* Includes **at least 1 uppercase letter**
* Includes **at least 1 lowercase letter**
* Includes **at least 1 number**
* Includes **at least 1 cyber-symbol**: `. * # @ $ % &`
* Contains **no other characters** — emojis, spaces, and alien glyphs trigger a **Red Alert**
