## 🧠 Situation Update

The megacorp is onto you.
They’ve begun altering the validation rules behind the scenes.
Static code won’t cut it anymore.

Your new objective:
🧬 **Manage password validation rules dynamically from a SQLite database**,
🧾 **Log every password validation attempt** into the same system.

You're not just breaching the firewall now.
You're rewriting its DNA.

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

### 📁 Objective 1: Store Rules in the Database

Instead of hardcoded rules, store them in a SQLite database.
Each rule should contain a description and should be activable.

✅ Only rules marked as `active` are applied.

---

### 🧠 Objective 2: Load Rules Dynamically in API

In your `/api/password-check`:

* Fetch all active rules from the database
* Apply to the submitted password
* Return the result per rule and overall validity

Rules might evolve without code changes—**you’re building a self-healing validator**.

---

### 🧾 Objective 3: Log Every Attempt

Each password check must be logged in a `logs` table.

💡 Use a secure hash algorithm (e.g. SHA-256) – never store raw passwords.

---

## ⚙️ Required Tech Stack

* 🧠 **SQLite** as the database
* 🧱 **Database schema** with migrations or auto-creation
* 🌐 Frontend stays unchanged, still calling `/api/password-check`

---

## 💡 Bonus Missions

* Build a `/api/rules` endpoint to **list all rules**
* Add a `/api/logs` endpoint to view or filter logs
